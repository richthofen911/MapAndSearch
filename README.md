# MapAndSearch

#### How to set up and running with the application
1. Open the project in Android Studio.

2. Follow the pop-up windows to set required Android SDK location/Gradle version/missing build-tools(if necessary).

3. When Gradle build is finished and successful, click `Run` button on Android Studio's toolbar

#### Expected display and result
- The screen should show a search input field at the top and a map below it.
- After a location is input and selected, the map's camera would move to that location based on its
  latitude and longitude with an animation. A marker would be shown at the
  exact place to indicate the location.
